Although the Court finds no authority in the Eighth Circuit on point, persuasive authority supports ARIC’s position that, in the absence of other evidence of pretext, the fact that ARIC applied a uniform medical certification policy to an employee and terminated a non-complying employee does not satisfy Manning’s burden of proving pretext. See, e.g., Walsh v. United Parcel Service, 201 F.3d 718, 729-30 (6th Cir.2000) (employee was lawfully terminated because of failure to respond to employer’s requests for medical information necessary to demonstrate entitlement to medical leave, not to avoid paying disability benefits); Godfrey, 89 F.3d at 759 (<HOLDING>); Barbour v.

53078,"Identify the correct case holding using the following information: explanations. The explanations were neither clear and specific nor related to the case being tried. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a new trial. ¶ 32 WE CONCUR: JUDITH M. BILLINGS, Presiding Judge and PAMELA T. GREENWOOD, Judge. 1 . This issue would best be addressed by an amendment to the Utah Rules of Criminal Procedure. This opinion should not be read as a comment, positive or negative, on the appropriateness of the rule the State proposes. 2 . Because Valdez’s step two challenge constitutes a sufficient basis to reverse, we do not reach his alternate step three argument. Further, we do not reach Valdez’s arguments regarding the admissibility of Battered Woman Syndrome evidence within the context of this case. See State v. Heaton, 958 P.2d 911, 919 (Utah 1998)",2,4,0,0
53100,"Identify the correct case holding using the following information: marks omitted). Statements by a child witness about abuse, to include the identity of the abuser, are admissible under this exception. Lingle, 27 M.J. at 704; United States v. Fling, 40 M.J. 847 (A.F.C.M.R.1994). “Cases of child sexual abuse have presented particular challenges to our courts when analyzing the expectations of very young children.” Russell, 66 M.J. at 606. Although the required proof is relaxed by ting a thorough physical examination, as well as a history of the alleged complaints. Further, Dr. MH had a medical justification in learning the identity of the alleged abuser. Based on a totality of the circumstances, we conclude the military judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting the statements. See United States v. Marchesano, 67 M.J. 535 (Army Ct.Crim.App.2008) (<HOLDING>). Legal and Factual Sufficiency We review",0,4,0,1
53129,"Identify the correct case holding using the following information: 545 (1958). The “tied” product is typically from a different but interdependent market (i.e. printer and printer cartridges). Such tying agreements can constitute an injury to competition when “the seller has market power over the tying product,” and the seller “can leverage this market power through tying arrangements to exclude other sellers of the tied product.” Cascade Health Solutions v. PeaceHealth, 515 F.3d 883, 912 (9th Cir.2008). “Bundling” is defined as “the practice of offering, for a single price, two or more goods or services that could be sold separately.” Id. at 884. Bundling can constitute an injury to competition when a bundler is able to use discounting, for example, to “exclude rivals who do not sell as great a number of product lines.” Id. at 897; see id. at 910(<HOLDING>).

53132,"Identify the correct case holding using the following information: records destroyed 2-17-05.” Mr. Alexce offered nothing to suggest that any materials he submitted that were not duplicative were missing from the file, much less suggesting what those materials might have said that could be helpful to his claim. There is no force to the argument that the destruction of duplicative materials constitutes spoliation of evidence or that there is anything improper in the DVA’s practice of retaining only a single copy of particular medical records in veterans’ claim files in an effort to maintain orderly records. The routine destruction of duplicative documents does not present the risk of denying an adversary access to relevant information, which is what the doctrine of spoliation is directed to. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1375 (Fed.Cir.2007) (<HOLDING>); see also Kirkendall v. Dep’t of the Army, 573",2,4,2,1
53133,"Identify the correct case holding using the following information: practice. Speaking with Dr. Fadel was only tangentially related to that responsibility. Her performance was thus an insubstantial part of the agreement, and therefore was insufficient to make the statute of frauds inapplicable. Because the alleged contract was not in wilting as required by the statute of frauds, and because no exception to the statute of frauds is applicable, we hold that the contract is unenforceable and Dr. Johnson therefore cannot sue for its breach. C. As an alternative to the breach of contract claim, Dr. Johnson argues that UHS should be prevented from refusing to provide her with t 90, 322 S.E.2d 733, 735 (1984) (same), with Augusta Surgical Ctr., Inc. v.
